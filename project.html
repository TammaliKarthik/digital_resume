            <h1>IOT BASED SMART CRADLE SYSTEM FOR BABY MONITORING</h1>
            <p>The loT-based smart cradle system for baby monitoring is an innovative solution aimed at providing parents with real-time insights into their baby's well-being and comfort. This case study examines the development, implementation, and benefits of such a system, highlighting its features, functionality, and impact on parenting .Since we are in the twenty first century parents of small child are do jobs or work. They might have work to be done at home also. So simultaneously doing work and monitoring the baby could be trouble. So, for these many kinds of parent we are developing a cradle which consist of too many useful features. Cradle system has ability to send alert when baby is crying, it can also swing automatically when baby is crying. Cradle system also gives alert when baby does potty in the cradle. Cradle also has the ability to send alert regarding body temperature of the baby. There is some High alert also available regarding babiesâ€™ health. Likewise, there are multiple features in the cradle system. For sending the alert we are using Buzzers . Cradle system is the solution of the multiple problems.</p>
